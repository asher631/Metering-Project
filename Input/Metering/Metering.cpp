* This library will wrap the ADE7753 library, and will provide easy functions to
* read the instantaneous power, to read the total energy developed, to reset the 
* cache.
*	
* Primary functions of this library are to read the total power developed 
* and to read the current instantaneous power at the current moment. The
* library will also have a method for resetting the device.
